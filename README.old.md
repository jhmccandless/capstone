Welcome to One and Done!

This is the classic Pig game with dice but renamed.

The application uses React with Redux for the framework and state management. Material UI is also used at select points for easy styling, though most of the styling was done myself.

For a new game, welcome to go the link in the header or follow the link on the homepage.

Fill out the Players' and game informaton, though welcome to use the default settings to play.

The game continues by pressing the square dice and the rules dictate the gameplay. The rules are in the rules link in the game.

The scores shows the winners from all the games played in order by the percentage of the win over the loser.

All scores and username information are stored using postgreSQL as well as used Beekeeper to visualize the database.

Enjoy!
